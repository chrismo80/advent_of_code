# advent_of_code

This is my AOC repo which I use to learn Rust.
Coming from C#, and having already done most of the AOC puzzles, this is a good opportunity to learn a new language.

The years / days are separated by indiviual Rust modules.
The input files are on the ignore list and are not part of the repository.

If you want to try your own inputs, create an input.txt file for each in the day module folders beside the mod.rs files so they can be found.
